# Howdy, I’m Ritesh 👋


iOS & React Native developer • Building tools, experiments & UI kits  

I love working with **React Native + SwiftUI**, bridging native iOS effects into JavaScript and creating open-source libraries.

- 🌀 Creator of [expo-liquid-glass-view](https://github.com/rit3zh/expo-liquid-glass-view) (native SwiftUI modifiers for RN)
- 🎨 Exploring animations, shaders & UI design in React Native
- 🚀 Building side projects & sharing experiments on GitHub
- 💡 Always tinkering with iOS-style UI/UX inside React Native
